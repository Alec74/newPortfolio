For this project I rebuilt my portfolio adding completed projects as the showcased developments.

The objectives to complete this Project include the following:

When loading the webpage the user is presented...

* Link to downloadable pdf of resume
* A showcase project stands out from the others
* 2-3 more projects are displayed
